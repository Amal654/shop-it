This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Discount Rules:

1. "flat_10_discount": If cart total exceeds $200, apply a flat $10 discount on the cart total.
2. "bulk_5_discount": If quantity of any single product exceeds 10 units, apply a 5% discount on that item's total price.
3. "bulk_10_discount": If total quantity exceeds 20 units, apply a 10% discount on the cart total.
4. "tiered_50_discount": If total quantity exceeds 30 units & any single product quantity greater than 15, then apply a 50% discount on products which are above  15 quantity. The first 15 quantity have the original price and unit above 15 will get 50% discount.

## Fees:

1. Gift wrap fee: $1 per unit.
2. Shipping fee: 10 units can be packed in one package, and the shipping fee for each package is $5.

### Only one rule can be applied per purchase. If multiple discounts are applicable, the program calculates the discount amount for each rule and applies the most beneficial one for customer.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
